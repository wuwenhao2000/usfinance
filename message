Sell Stop Order 股价抵达或低于stop value，触发卖出
A trader has bought a stock at $35 a share but wishes to risk no more than a $5 per share loss 
on the trade. He places a sell stop order just below the $30 a share level, perhaps at $29.50. 
If the market price falls to the $29.50 level, then the sell stop order is triggered, and the 
trader's stock is sold at the next available market price.

sell stop-limit 股价抵达或低于stop value，并且高于limit value，才触发卖出

buy stop-limit 股价抵达或高于stop value，并且低于limit value，才触发买入
For example, assume that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading at $170.00 and an investor wants to buy 
the stock once it begins to show some serious upward momentum. The investor has put in a stop-limit 
order to buy with the stop price at $180.00 and the limit price at $185.00. If the price of AAPL 
moves above the $180.00 stop price, the order is activated and turns into a limit order. As long 
as the order can be filled under $185.00, which is the limit price, the trade will be filled. 
If the stock gaps above $185.00, the order will not be filled.

Buy Stop Order 股价抵达或高于stop value，触发买入
Consider the price movement of a stock ABC that is poised to break out of its trading range of 
between $9 and $10. Let’s a say a trader bets on a price increase beyond that range for ABC and 
places a buy stop order at $10.20. Once the stock hits that price, the order becomes a market 
order and the trading system purchases stock at the next available price.

Buy Limit Order 股价抵达或者低于limit value，触发买入
If the trader places a buy order at $2.40 and the order is not triggered during the trading day, 
as long as that order remains in place it could benefit from a gap down. If the price opens the 
next day at $2.20, the trader will get the shares at $2.20 as that was the first price available 
at or below $2.40. While the trader is paying a lower price than expected, they may want to 
consider why the price gapped down so aggressively, and if they still want to own the shares.

Sell Limit Order 股价抵达或者高于Limite value，触发卖出
sell limit order is an order to sell a security at a pre-specified price or higher.
